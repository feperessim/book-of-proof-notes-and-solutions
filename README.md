# Book of Proof - Notes and Solutions

Welcome to the "Book of Proof - Notes and Solutions" repository. This
repository is dedicated to storing my notes and solutions for the
third edition of **Book of Proof**, authored by Richard Hammack.

**Book of Proof** is an introductory resource that equips readers with
the skills and knowledge needed to construct mathematical proofs. It
serves as a fundamental guide for anyone interested in learning how to
read and write mathematical proofs.

Understanding the art of writing mathematical proofs is crucial for
developing critical thinking skills and delving into mathematics at a
more advanced and profound level. This understanding is particularly
invaluable for computer scientists, like myself, enabling them to
comprehend, analyze, and construct proofs, especially in the context
of algorithmic analysis, but not limited to.

The book, **Book of Proof**, is generously available under the
Creative Commons License. You can find a detailed summary of its
